My main teaching revolves around **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning** in different formats and for different audiences. I was awarded a final round nomination for the "Best Teaching - Best Practices" award of my university in 2017 for [my contribution](https://stdm.github.io/Science-applied) under the topic "Wissenschaftlichkeit" ("scientific character"), and [won it](https://stdm.github.io/ATLAS/) (3rd place) in 2019 for the "Vermittlung von Grundlagen" ("teaching of foundational matters"). My shorter teaching statement [from 2008](http://www.informatik.uni-marburg.de/~stadelmann/teaching.html) is still valid: "I love teaching. To initiate inside someone the vision of an idea, to see understanding grow, these are moments I greatly enjoy."

## Online courses

I try to make my main courses available as free online ressources as a best effort offer.

  * [Artificial Intelligence](http://stdm.github.io/ai-course) (KI1): final year elective course in the Bachelor of Computer Science degree program of ZHAW. Available online with full course material, videos (currently shot: HS 2018) and audio-only recordings. Taught in German, material in English.
  * [Machine Learning](http://stdm.github.io/ml-course) (TSM_MachLe): elective technical scientific specialization module on the [Master of Science in Engineering](https://www.msengineering.ch/en/home.html) program, focus area ICT / Data Science. Material & lectures in English.
