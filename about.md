The is the personal website of [Thilo Stadelmann](http://www.zhaw.ch/=stdm), senior lecturer at [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/) [School of Engineering](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/), deputy head of [InITâ€˜s](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/) [Information Engineering Group](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/engineering/institute-zentren/init/information-engineering/) and head of the [ZHAW Datalab](www.zhaw.ch/datalab).

All views expressed are mine and not necessarily shared by ZHAW, InIT or the Datalab.

I am a computer scientist by training, an AI guy by passion, and a Machine Learning researcher by research area. My research interests revolve around general principles for learning algorithms. I approach these by means of use cases from very diverse areas, e.g. multimedia analysis, speech and audio processing, optical music recognition, predictive maintenance, automated game playing, data mining, driving assistants, computer vision, face recognition, ...

My current research interests revolve around deep neural networks for pattern recognition problems, and reinforcement learning for general control.

### CV, publications, etc.
