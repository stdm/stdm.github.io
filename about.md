This is the personal website of [Thilo Stadelmann](http://www.zhaw.ch/=stdm), professor of computer science at [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/) [School of Engineering](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/) and holder of the chair of Engineering ‒ Information, deputy head of [InIT‘s](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/) [Information Engineering Group](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/engineering/institute-zentren/init/information-engineering/) and head of the [ZHAW Datalab](www.zhaw.ch/datalab).

All views expressed are mine and not necessarily shared by ZHAW, InIT or the Datalab.

I am a computer scientist by training, an AI guy by passion, and a machine perception researcher by research area. My research interests revolve around general principles for learning algorithms in machine learning. I approach these by means of use cases from very diverse areas, e.g. multimedia analysis, speech and audio processing, optical music recognition, predictive maintenance, automated game playing, data mining, driving assistants, computer vision, face recognition, ...

My current [research interests](https://stdm.github.io/research/) revolve around deep neural networks for pattern recognition problems, and reinforcement learning for general control.

Personally, I like kitesurfing and mountainbiking, enjoy playing music on stringed instruments (guitars, bass), and am a follower of [Jesus Christ](https://odb.org/). I try living by the following values (my closer colleagues know I am not there yet): excellence; wisdom; honor all people; mercy for failure; and courage.
