<a name="objectives"></a>  
## Educational objectives

1. You know the breadth of AI problem solving strategies
  * ...thus identify such challenges in practice
  * ...and develop corresponding solutions on your own.
2. You can explain the discussed algorithms and methodologies
  * ...and are able to transfer it to the real world.

**What is it all about?** Computer opponents in games, fastest route in navigation devices, optimized flight schedules, decision support in hospitals, design of pharmaceutical proteins to fight cancer - the foundation of all these fascinating application is "Artificial Intelligence" (AI).

**Why is it relevant?** Since the 1960s, AI is about developing solutions for complex problems that could formerly only be solved by humans. AI is a classical subdiscipline of computer science. Its methods are so universally used that our text book for this course is among the 25 most-cited scientific publications on Citeseer!

**Who should attend?** This is a very much practice-oriented course on selected foundations of AI and Machine Learning (ML), aiming at hands-on problem solving competency for everyday software challenges. It is geared towards everyone who is curious for smart software and is especially relevant for software engineers, would-be data scientists and as a foundation for further interdisciplinary studies in areas like information engineering, speech processing, computer vision or robotics.
