I studied computer science in Giessen and Marburg and received the Doctor of Science degree from [Marburg University](https://www.informatik.uni-marburg.de/~stadelmann/), Germany, in 2010, where I worked on multimedia analysis and voice recognition. I held engineering and leadership roles in the automotive industry for several years prior to my appointment at the ZHAW. My current research interests revolve around robust representation learning in deep neural networks for pattern recognition problems; how to learn structured and actionable representations for world models; and societal effects of AI. My group and research is introduced in more detail [below](#group).

Personally, I like kitesurfing, enjoy playing music on stringed instruments (guitars, bass), and am a follower of <a href="https://odb.org/">Jesus Christ</a>. If this makes you curious, send me an email with a meeting request (subject "30 minutes on faith"), I am happy to explain. I try living by the following values (my closer colleagues know I am not there yet): excellence; wisdom; honor all people; mercy for failure; and courage.

## The group

[<img alt="The ZHAW Centre for AI members as of March 2024" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/CAI-2024.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/CAI-2024.jpg)

The [Machine Perception and Cognition Group](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/machine-perception-and-cognition-group/) performs project-based research in **representation learning** for **pattern recognition**, working on a wide variety of tasks on image, audio or generally "signal" data. As a group, we focus on **deep learning** methodology, inspired by biological learning. Each task that we study has its own learning target (e.g., detection, classification, clustering, segmentation, novelty detection, control) and use case (e.g., **predictive maintenance**, **speaker diarization**  for multimedia indexing, **document analysis**, **optical music recognition**, **computer vision** for industrial quality control, **automated machine learning**, **deep reinforcement learning** for automated game play or building control), which in turn sheds light on different aspects of the learning process. We also engage in interdisciplinary work on the ethical and societal aspects of AI.

The group has very diverse backgrounds, which helps us complement each other's skills.

### Robust and practical deep learning <details>
<summary>...</summary>

<img alt="Examples of automatic segmentation" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/article_segmentation.jpg"/>

<p>Deep learning has long reached the <a href="https://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ANNPR_2018d.pdf">point of practical applicability</a> in solving day-to-day tasks in many non-AI businesses, for instance manufacturing SMEs. Specific challenges arise and are tackled in our <a href="http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ADS_2019_DeepLearning.pdf">applied research projects</a>, ranging from data quality and quantity issues to higher requirements on robustness and resilience of the models. For instance, segmenting newspaper pages into articles that semantically belong together is a necessary prerequisite for article-based information retrieval on print media collections like e.g. archives and libraries. It is challenging due to vastly differing layouts of papers, various content types and different languages, but commercially very relevant for e.g. media monitoring.</p>

<img alt="Newspaper article segmentation architecture" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/fcnn_architecture.jpg"/>

<p>Here, we have developed a <a href="http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ICDAR_2017.pdf">semantic segmentation approach</a> based on the visual appearance of each page. We apply a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) that we train in an end-to-end fashion to transform the input image into a segmentation mask in one pass. We show experimentally that the FCN performs very well: it outperforms a deep learning-based commercial solution by a large margin in terms of segmentation quality while in addition being computationally two orders of magnitude more efficient. The whole system is trained with only 5,500 images of which less than 500 are fully labeled.</p>

<img alt="Detecting adversarial examples using local spatial entropy on feature response maps" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/adversarial_detection.jpg"/>

<p>At the same time, the existence of adversarial attacks on convolutional neural networks (CNN) questions the fitness of such models for serious applications. Such attacks manipulate an input image such that misclassification is evoked while still looking normal to a human observer - they are thus not easily detectable. In a different context, backpropagated activations of CNN hidden layers - "feature responses" to a given input - have been helpful to visualize for a human "debugger" what the CNN "looks at" while computing its output. We have proposed a novel <a href="http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ANNPR_2018c.pdf">detection method for adversarial examples</a> to prevent attacks. We do so by tracking adversarial perturbations in feature responses, allowing for automatic detection using average local spatial entropy. The method does not alter the original network architecture and is fully human-interpretable. Experiments confirm the validity of our approach for state-of-the-art attacks on large-scale models trained on ImageNet.</p>

<p>As a final example, the prediction of product quality in an industrial plastic injection molding process (plus the needed process parameter adjustments to return to a non-anomalous process) can in principle be predicted from the evolution of the pressure within the cavity/tool. The problem is that the process is highly susceptible to little changes in the environmental conditions: The pressure curves look vastly different if only the sun shines on the machine over noon, for example. Hence, building a robust deep model to predict anomalies (and hopefully machine parameters) is a challenge of sucessful transfer learning. A first approach that works well for anomaly detection in this setup has been <a href="https://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/SDS_2024c.pdf">published</a> based on VAE methods.</p>

### <summary>Representation learning for next-level AI</summary>

[<img alt="Illustration of Kolmogorov complexity: Perception and efficient learning are possible by reducing the flood of sensory signals produced by the environment to an underlying low-complexity description" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/kolmogorov.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/kolmogorov.jpg)

Deep learning has propelled the surge in AI in the last decade and will continue to find new applications and improvements. However, it is [forseeable](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/news/news/event-news/interdisziplinaere-diskussionsrunde-am-cai-kolloquium-eroertert-was-intelligenz-ist-und-wie-man-die-ki-der-gegenwart-voranbringen-kann/) that the methodology in itself will not produce higher-level cognition. Inspiration comes from neuroscientific research on understanding brain functionality. Here, we find the principle of self-organizing net fragments to be the inductive bias that fits models (developed brains) to the natural environment. We seek ways of implementing related ideas into deep learning frameworks to increas the generability and robustness of the approaches, which for example means to move away from purely error-driven learning by backgpropagation.

A current theme that makes the above arguments more tangible is how to learn actionable representations in world models that lead to representations structured in a way that allow desirable properties from interpretability to planning. Such structuring seems possible if models are not trained to just predict future values, but take intent (actions) into account to learn cause and effect, leading to a form of common sense.

### <summary>AI and society</summary>

[<img alt="t-SNE visualization of the embedding space created by two face recognition models, coloured by ethnicity and gender" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/face-bias.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/face-bias.jpg)

How a powerful technology like artificial intelligence engages with the world around us and impacts our societies must concern us as engineers (see also [a](https://stdm.github.io/Risk/), [b](https://stdm.github.io/Hope/), [c](https://stdm.github.io/AI-sports-humanism/)). Assessing the impact of the technology on society is a first step to shape AI for good. In this direction, we for example [analyzed](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-021-00108-6) how the effect of bias in face recognition systems can be quantified and mitigated. As our study shows, AI systems are very different from us humans: while for humans, conceiling information from us on sensitive attributes keeps us more fair / less biased, doing the same thing for a machine learning system - blinding it to attributes concerning e.g. gender or skin colour - does not result in less bias. Thus, bias does not equal awareness. 

We also follow this thread of trustworthiness through projects on AI [verification and certification](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/news/news/event-news/3-neue-forschungsprojekte-zielen-auf-den-einsatz-vertrauenswuerdiger-ki/) as well as collaborations with colleagues from the humanities in projects and committees. The goal is to find better narratives for a hope-filled future with AI.

[<img alt="Semantic segmentation pipeline to detect food waste" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/foodwaste.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/foodwaste.jpg)

A rich source for open research questions in deep-learning-based pattern recognition is found in various industrial processes like engineering and production. For example, we developed methods to reliably classify and quantify [food waste](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/about-us/news/news/event-news/tackling-food-waste-with-artificial-intelligence/) in large kitches through new semantic segmentation pipeline and worked a lot on automatic quality control. Other work in this area is going address the problem of [transferability](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/news/news/event-news/zhaw-and-kistler-team-up-to-evaluate-the-possibilities-of-deep-transfer-learning-for-controlling-injection-molding-processes/) of learnt knowledge from one tool to the next. As in industrial settings labelled data is usually scarce, a particular focus of our work is to make approaches more sample (or label) efficient than usual benchmark-beating models from the literature.

[<img alt="Vertebrae detection by deep learning model trained with unsupervised domain adaptation" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/vertebrae.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/vertebrae.jpg)

Similary, health applications of deep learning are a major topic in the group. For example, in a collaboration with the AI and Data Science CoE of the Kantonsspital Aarau, we have [developed a novel approach](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/8/8/222) to reliably identify vertebrae in 3D CT scans. Our primary contribution is a new Domain Sanity Loss (DSL) function for unsupervised domain adaptation. We achieve results that are on par with the current state-of-the-art algorithms for full supervised learning while using about 20 times fewer labels. This is a very interesting instance of a data-centric approach to be pursued further in our research.

Additional applications include the [reduction of motion artifacts in CT images](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/news/news/event-news/verbesserung-der-qualitaet-von-ct-bildern-mit-ki-und-deep-learning/), which can significantly reduce the risk for patients to develop secondary cancer during radiation therapy; the [automated monitoring](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/news/news/event-news/videoanalyse-zur-datengesteuerten-pflege-von-intensivpatienten/) of patients in intensive care; or the [homogenization of data](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/init/news/news/event-news/neue-publikation-welche-eine-methode-zur-homogenisierung-von-daten-fuer-die-covid-erkennung-aus-ct-bildern-vorstellt/) to train large, bias-free medical imaging models, as we showed in the context of the COVID-19 spread.

### <summary>Document recognition</summary>

[<img alt="Deep Watershed Detector architecture" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/dwd.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/dwd.jpg)

We have applied our skills in pattern recognition frequently to use cases in document recognition, for example to convert music scores to machine-readable form. Written music is a large and important part of cultural heritage worldwide. While there are many archives containing thousands of music scores, they are paper-based, so public access is cumbersome or even impossible. Digitization of these scores has for a long time been impossible due to the non-availability of scanning software that can convert hand-written scores to machine-readable format (Optical Music Recognition – OMR). Our DeepScore and RealScore projects aimed at bringing bleeding edge technology form computer vision the field of OMR. The impact of OMR on how we curate, preserve and access music manuscripts cannot be overstated. Fully functional OMR would lead to a democratization of the musical cultural heritage by enabling cheap and efficient access by everyone. It would also enable more efficient music training, and enable orchestras to run cheaper and rehearse more efficiently. 

To facilitate deep learning for OMR, we built the [DeepScores](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ICPR_2018a.pdf) [dataset](https://tuggeluk.github.io/deepscores/) with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in small object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of scene understanding. DeepScores contains high quality images of musical scores, partitioned into 300'000 sheets of written music that contain symbols of different shapes and sizes. With close to a hundred million small objects, this makes our dataset not only unique, but also the largest public dataset. DeepScores comes with ground truth for object classification, detection and semantic segmentation. We provide baseline performances for object classification and intuition for the inherent difficulty that DeepScores poses to state-of-the-art object detectors like YOLO or R-CNN.

We introduced a novel object detection method, based on synthetic energy maps and the watershed transform, called [Deep Watershed Detector (DWD)](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ISMIR_2018.pdf). Our method is specifically tailored to deal with high resolution images that contain a large number of very small objects and is therefore able to process full pages of written music. We present state-of-the-art detection results of common music symbols and show DWD’s ability to work with synthetic scores equally well as on handwritten music. Further results in making OMR more robust trhough _domain adaptation_ can also be found [here](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/news/news-releases/news-detail/event-news/realscore-scannen-von-real-world-noten-fuer-ein-digitales-notenpult/).

Current work focuses on building a foundation model for document recognition, based on the insight that natural images and scans of documents for human consumption are very different in kind, hence need different inductive biases: Document recognition is better understood as transcription (of one format for information losslessly into another) rather than recognition.

Meta learning, or learning to learn is very interesting from the perspective of what learning in machines and bezond actuallz means. We have for instance built a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that, once trained, directly outputs a probabilistic clustering of a batch of input examples in one pass. It estimates a distribution over the number of clusters and, for each number of clusters up to a maximum, distributions over the respective data partitioning. The neural network is trained in a supervised fashion to group data by any perceptual similarity criterion based on pairwise labels (same/different group). It does not expect to have seen any of the groups that appear during model application already during training. We demonstrate promising performance on high-dimensional data like images (COIL-100) and speech (TIMIT). We call this [learning to cluster](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ANNPR_2018a.pdf). We have also produced a survey and some novel results on the more general topic of [meta learning](https://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/SDS_2019.pdf).

[<img alt="Architecture of the successful RNN model for speaker clustering" src="http://stdm.github.io/images/RNN_architecture.jpg"/>](http://stdm.github.io/images/RNN_architecture.jpg)

[My PhD research](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/PhdThesis_2010) focused on the task of speaker clustering: grouping speech segments by speaker identity without prior knowledge of the number or identity of speakers (a prerequisite for e.g. content-based media indexing). While speaker identification usually achieved accuracy percentages in their high nineties, the state of the art for the more complex task of clustering performed an order of magnitude worse. 

My 2009 ACM Multimedia paper on [Unfolding Speaker Clustering Potential – a Biomimetic Approach](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ACMMM_2009.pdf) (see also the [code](https://github.com/stdm/time_model)) not only analyzed this fact, but also identified deficiencies in modeling the sequence of speech features as the bottleneck responsible for the slump in performance. The prediction of potentially raising speaker clustering performance by an order of magnitude by better sequence modeling has led to exciting discoveries so far. We successively built deep learning models with more clustering capability to exploit the sequence information: a [simple CNN](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/MLSP_2016.pdf), [CNN with optimized clustering loos](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/MLSP_2017.pdf) and finally a [RNN](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ANNPR_2018b.pdf) to improve the capturing of prosodic voice information, to reduce the error rate for pure voice comparison by the predicted rate (see [code](https://github.com/stdm/ZHAW_deep_voice)). Additionally, using a [different clustering algorithm](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/papers/ICPR_2018b.pdf) on top of the simple CNN feature embeddings also proved valuable.

This line of research has also lead to work on other audio processing tasks like media segmentation and classification, musical instrument recognition, audio fingerprinting, or voice transfer, mainly driven forward in student thesis projects.

I helped in creating one of Europe's first dedicated research centers for data science, the [ZHAW Datalab](http://www.zhaw.ch/datalab), and lead it until 2018. Subsequently, my colleagues and I created one of Switzerland's first continuing education programs in data science, the [MAS Data Science](https://weiterbildung.zhaw.ch/de/school-of-engineering/programm/mas-data-science.html), where I teach machine learning. In 2015, we started rolling out the successful Datalab collaboration model country-wide in founding the [Data Innovation Alliance](https://data-innovation.org/), a network of industrial and academic partner institutions that also furthered the [Swiss Conference on Data Science](https://sds2022.ch/) series of events that [started in Winterthur](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/research/inter-school-cooperation/datalab-the-zhaw-data-science-laboratory/sds2014/). The experience gained in these activities, together with the feedback from the applied research projects described above, lead to a [book](https://stdm.github.io/data-science-book/) I co-edited together with my colleagues [Martin Braschler](http://www.zhaw.ch/=bram) and [Kurt Stockinger](http://www.zhaw.ch/=stog).

In 2021, I co-chaired the [1st International Symposium on the Science of Data Science](https://www.sds2022.ch/1st-international-symposium-on-the-science-of-data-science). In the course of reviewing the development of the field in the past decade, we came to the conclusion that it is _data centrism_ – the reliance on data itself, in mindset, methods and products – that makes data science more than the sum of its parts, as this is not done in any other discipline.
