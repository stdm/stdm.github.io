This is the companion website to my one semester course on machine learning, co-taught with [Prof. Christoph Wuersch](https://www.ntb.ch/mitarbeiter/christoph-wuersch/) from the NTB Buchs. The course is part of the [Master of Science in Engineering](https://www.msengineering.ch/en/home.html) (MSE) program in computer science and data science, offered collaboratively by the engineering faculties of the Swiss universities of applied sciences. This website reflects the status quo as of spring term 2019.

## Educational objectives

1. Students **know** the **background and taxonomy** of machine learning methods.

2. On this basis, they **formulate** given problems as **learning tasks** and **select** a **proper learning method**.

3. Students are **able to convert** a data set into a proper **feature set** fitting for a task at hand.

4. They **evaluate** the chosen **approach** in a structured way using proper design of experiment.

5. Students **know how** to select models, and **"debug"** features and learning algorithms if results do not fit expectations.

6. Students are able to leverage on the evaluation framework to **tune the parameters** of a given system and **optimize** its performances.

7. Students **have seen examples of different data** sources / problem types and are **able to acquire additional expert knowledge** from the scientific literature.

Machine learning (ML) emerged out of artificial intelligence and computer science as the academic discipline concerned with "giving computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" (A. Samuel, 1959). Today, it is the methodological driver behind the mega-trends of big data and data science. ML experts are highly sought after in industry and academia alike.

This course builds upon basic knowledge in math, programming and analytics/statistics as is typically gained in respective undergraduate courses of diverse engineering disciplines. From there, it teaches the foundations of modern machine learning techniques in a way that focuses on practical applicability to real-world problems. The complete process of building a learning system is considered:

- formulating the task at hand as a learning problem;

- extracting useful features from the available data;

- choosing and parameterizing a suitable learning algorithm.

Covered topics include cross-cutting concerns like ML system design and debugging (how to get intuition into learned models and results) as well as feature engineering; covered algorithms include (amongst others) Support Vector Machines (SVM) and ensemble methods.
