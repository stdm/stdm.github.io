The staff prayer meeting at ZHAW takes place roughly weekly at the premises of the [Stadtmission Winterthur](http://www.stadtmission-winterthur.ch/) (entry from the rear side at Neumarkt). The corner room Technikumstrasse/Neumarkt on the ground floor usually hosts staff and faculty members from different departments and all Christian denominations. Over lunchtime, we sing, hear a passage from the Bible, and split into smaller groups to pray for each other's needs as well as for our university, colleagues and students. Occasionally, we go out to lunch together afterwards. The meetings are lead by [Josef Adam](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/adjo/).

Fall term 2019 meetings: weekly alternating between Tuesdays and Thursdays; 12:00 worship, 12:10 input, 12:15-12:30 prayer

If you want to meet fellow Christian colleagues, be encouraged and prayed for, and make use of our privilege to ask God's blessing for our place of work, we cordially welcome you at any of our meetings. If you are in Zurich, you might be interested in the [Dozentenforum](http://www.dozentenforum.ch/) of colleagues form ETH and UZH. If you are a student, you might be interested in the [VBG Winterthur](http://winti.vbg.net/).
