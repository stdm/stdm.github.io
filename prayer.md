The staff prayer meeting at ZHAW usually takes place weekly on Tuesdays from 12:00-12:30 at the Cafeteria of the [Stadtmission Winterthur](http://www.stadtmission-winterthur.ch/) (entry from the rear side at Neumarkt) and additionally every other week on Thursdays in the [Gebetshaus Winterthur](https://www.gebetshauswinterthur.ch/kontakt) (same time, followed by joint lunch; entry to the prayer room is from Untertor 34, to the right of bakery Kuhn, then with the elevator to the 4. floor). 

The rooms usually host staff and faculty members from different departments and all Christian denominations. Over lunchtime, we sing, hear a passage from the Bible, and split into smaller groups to pray for each other's needs as well as for our university, colleagues and students. The meetings are lead by [Martin Winkler](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/winl/) and [Tibor Dudas](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/duda/), and there is also a dedicated [MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a29c1fc51c21e450baa2944cdf84edee8%40thread.tacv2/online%2520prayer%2520meeting?groupId=91902fe1-3c0c-4018-b6f0-8920beb9c168&tenantId=5d1a9f9d-201f-4a10-b983-451cf65cbc1e) channel.

> So that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
1 Corinthians 12, 25-27
