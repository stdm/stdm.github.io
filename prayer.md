The staff prayer meeting at ZHAW takes place roughly weekly at the premises of the [Stadtmission Winterthur](http://www.stadtmission-winterthur.ch/) (entry from the rear side at Neumarkt). The corner room Technikumstrasse/Neumarkt on the ground floor usually hosts staff and faculty members from different departments and all Christian denominations. Over lunchtime, we sing, hear a passage from the Bible, and split into smaller groups to pray for each other's needs as well as for our university, colleagues and students. Occasionally, we go out to lunch together afterwards. The meetings are lead by [Josef Adam](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/about-us/person/adjo/).

**CORONA UPDATE**: due to the current situation, we meet online of hybrid (online in addition of physically meetings in Winterthur). You find us in a [video conference in MS Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a29c1fc51c21e450baa2944cdf84edee8%40thread.tacv2/online%2520prayer%2520meeting?groupId=91902fe1-3c0c-4018-b6f0-8920beb9c168&tenantId=5d1a9f9d-201f-4a10-b983-451cf65cbc1e) during the times below, and can read and post encouragements and prayer requests in our [MS Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a31f2ecb60756442d9bb0fb1cbfe4f228%40thread.tacv2/Allgemein?groupId=91902fe1-3c0c-4018-b6f0-8920beb9c168&tenantId=5d1a9f9d-201f-4a10-b983-451cf65cbc1e).
