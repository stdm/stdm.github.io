Abstract
- [typical architecture: ca. 1-2 sentences for each of motivation; problem statement; approach; results; relevency of results]

1. Introduction
- Motivation [understandable also for a general audience]
- Problem statement [formulation of research question]
(- Own contributions [novelties you claim as your own])
(- Organization of thesis [brief description of how the remaining chapters are organized])

2. Foundations
- [Introduction of foundations not generally known to professionals in computer science]
- Related work [similar to respective chapters in papers: review the relevant related work by briefly summarizing it incl.used methods and achieved results, and then contrasting it with own task, i.e., show any gaps to own problem statement]

3. Methods [title could be made less generic]
- [Describe and argue for own methodology/approach: how does your approach work, why did you choose it? The latter could also be discussed in ch. 2]

4. Experiments & Results
- [Experimental setup, results, discussion of results incl. their relevancy & limitations; specific organization is very depedenent on the individual situation]

5. Conclusions
- Summary [Summarize your thesis, including approach, results, and main knowledge gaines; brag about what you have achieved! Speculate about future]
- Future work [short-, mid-, and long-term things one sould do; this can be a very valuable, and hence, longer, section]

Bibliography
- [take care to format entries well]
