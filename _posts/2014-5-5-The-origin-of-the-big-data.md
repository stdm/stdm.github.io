Earlier this year, my colleague <a title="Kurt Stockinger @ ZHAW" href="http://www.zhaw.ch/fileadmin/php_includes/popup/person-detail.php?kurzz=stog" target="_blank">Kurt</a> and I have written an <a title="Data Science fÃ¼r Lehre, Forschung und Praxis" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1365/s40702-014-0040-1?sa_campaign=email/event/articleAuthor/onlineFirst" target="_blank">article</a> (in german language) that included a chapter on the origin of big _amounts of_ data. In this article, we adopted the view that the _term_ big data ultimately stemmed from the <a title="The 3 Vs" href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/forum/topics/the-3vs-that-define-big-data" target="_blank">3Vs</a> (variety, velocity & volume) as attributes of the growing flood of data: the amount, the number of sources and the speed at which new data arrives is very large, i.e., &#8220;big&#8221;.

Recently, I&#8217;ve read the <a title="Wikipedia: Big Data" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="_blank">Wikipedia article on big data</a>, and there one thing hit me: In the &#8220;See also&#8221; section, the term &#8220;big data&#8221; is brought into relationship with terms like &#8220;Big Oil&#8221;, &#8220;Big Tobacco&#8221;, &#8220;Big Media&#8221; etc.<!--more-->

A very interesting connotation that is: at least as much as from the description of a natural phenomenon, the term big data might stem from a whole industrie&#8217;s hope of having found the <a title="Clive Humby: Data is the new oil" href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/08/24/data-is-the-new-oil-tech-giants-may-be-huge-but-nothing-matches-big-data/" target="_blank">new oil</a>, of getting new business opportunities and of launching the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; after the internet and mobile revolution.This explains why the term is constantly being pushed by industry since several years as can be seen by the number of (industry-organized) events/conferences etc.

And on the other hand, this connotation also expresses the fear of individuals being delivered into the hands a &#8220;big brother&#8221;, just like it is expressed as a present reailty in the other &#8220;Big*&#8221; terms from above.

So &#8211; what is big data? A description of the growing state of data, a hope for business opportunities, and a subtle hint to the attached dangers of this business. All 3 dimensions are worthy to be explored and have to be researched.
