Some articles/books that I recently found enriching to read:

  * Leo Breiman on [Statistical Modeling: the Two Cultures](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726): it isÂ written with a touch of polemic, but for me it was a valuable read (together with the attached academic discussion with his "opponents") about traditional statistical modeling and machine learning.
  * Yu et al.'s [Feature Engineering and Classifier Ensemble for KDD Cup 2010](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/paper/doc/wskdd10cup.pdf) gave me valuable insight in how to make a lasting impact on Kaggle's leader boeard together with a group of students. More on this is probably [here](http://www.kaggle.com/about/papers) (not read yet).
  * A good introduction to Hadoop and Map Reduce is the [Hadoop Beginner's Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/hadoop-beginners-guide/book) by Turkington: enough detail for self-study, practical in the sense you learn to set up and really use (program) hadoop, not too lengthy (only a bit).
  * Last but not least: Siegel's popular science book [Predictive Analytics](http://www.amazon.de/Predictive-Analytics-Power-Predict-Click/dp/1118356853) gives some nice examples what a company can get from data science (a bit lengthy due to lots of anecdotes and layman speak).
