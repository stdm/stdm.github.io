I started to read Nils Nilssons&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="The Quest for Artificial Intelligence" href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf" target="_blank">Quest for Artificial Intelligence</a>&#8220;. It&#8217;s intended to be also readable for the interested layperson, but should give a good and readable overview of the field with a historic perspective: way pursued, paths abandoned, goals reached.

What makes me curious is what Prof. Nilsson himself points out in the foreword: maybe some abandoned ideas from the path are more realistic with todays technology (computing power, distributed systems, learning from massive amounts of data, &#8230;).

The eBook (PDF) Version is availabale for free from Prof. Nilsson&#8217;s <a title="The Quest for Artificial Intelligence" href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf" target="_blank">homepage</a>.
