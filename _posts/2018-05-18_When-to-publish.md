Coming to the end of a writing-heavy week with 5 paper deadlines, the experience from these publishing processes reinforced the three necessary conditions to me on when to publish. When is my work advanced enough that I can publish it? When can I attempt not only writing it down (you should also do it as it clears one's thoughts), but also making it accessible for the rest of the world (being aware of your responsibility not only for the body of human knowledge, the time of potential readers, and your future reputation)?

It comes down to the [triple filters of Socrates](https://www.quora.com/What-is-Triple-Filter-test-of-Socrates):

1. **Truth**: are your results true? Do your trust your experiments? If you are aware of (or suspect) any bugs, abstain from publishing the results. If you have randmly fluctuating results, abstain from reporting cherry-picked good-looking ones.

2. **Goodness**: is what you want to say novel and beneficial to the reader, i.e., interesting? You have a responsibility of not polluting someone's reading list with something you know is in the end not helpful. You haver to have something to say, i.e., something to add to what is already out there.

3. **Necessity**: even if your result is somewhat novel and correct, does it help? Is your approach doing something different (showing different properties, even if not giving better results) than existing alternative solutions? Can you pinpoint reasons why it is worthwhile occupying oneself with your work?

If your intended work - even your final writeup - passes all three ancient filters, go forth and submit it.
