Some articles/books that I recently found enriching to read:

  * Leo Breiman on <a title="Machine Learning paper" href="http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1009213726" target="_blank">&#8220;Statistical Modeling: the Two Cultures&#8221;</a>: it&#8217;sÂ written with a touch of polemic, but for me it was a valuable read (together with the attached academic discussion with his &#8220;opponents&#8221;) about traditional statistical modeling and machine learning
  * Yu et al.&#8217;s <a title="Feature Engineering paper" href="http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/paper/doc/wskdd10cup.pdf" target="_blank">&#8220;Feature Engineering and Classifier Ensemble for KDD Cup</a>
  
    2010&#8243; gave me valuable insight in how to make a lasting impact on Kaggle&#8217;s leader boeard together with a group of students. More on this is probably <a title="More papers on Kaggle" href="http://www.kaggle.com/about/papers" target="_blank">here </a>(not read yet).
  * A good introduction to Hadoop and Map Reduce is the <a title="Hadoop / Map-Reduce book" href="http://www.packtpub.com/hadoop-beginners-guide/book" target="_blank">&#8220;Hadoop Beginner&#8217;s Guide&#8221;</a> by Turkington: enough detail for self-study, practical in the sense you learn to set up and really use (program) hadoop, not too lengthy (only a bit).
  * Last but not least: Siegel&#8217;s popular science book <a title="Data Science book" href="http://www.amazon.de/Predictive-Analytics-Power-Predict-Click/dp/1118356853" target="_blank">&#8220;Predictive Analytics&#8221;</a> gives some nice examples what a company can get from data science (a bit lengthy due to lots of anecdotes and layman speak)
