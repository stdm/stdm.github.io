title: Scientific disciplines are foremost communities
---

For a young researcher the diversification in the academic landscape can bee a huge challenge: am I interested / proficient in machine learning - or pattern recognition? Am I a computer vision guy (because I work mainly on images), or in the field of predictive maintenance (because I also worked on such tasks)? Am I a data miner because I mine data, and can I also add artificial intelligence to the list of research interests just because I have published on its sub-field of machine learning?

### Communities of people

What I didn't understand as a young researcher is that these fields are foremost communities of people: they know (and further) each other, work with each other (often implicitly, by affecting / citing each other's work), and meet each other regularly (at the community's conferences and workshops). Most of all, they share a common [frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_(social_sciences)). This is brilliantly protraied in [Breiman's article](http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf) on the two cultures in statistics and machine learning: Both communities work on similar use cases and (more and more, to some extend) with a common body of methodologies. Yet they do it with a totally different understanding of their work and its goals (as becomes evident e.g. in the different view on dimensionality reduction). 

Communities are a social construct, not a perfect ontology of the scientific world. They overlapto some extend, may disagree, have their own (unwritten) rules based on a common perception of "the field". On the other hand, people strive in communities because they offer affirmation, visibility, recognition amongst peers.

### Implications

When academic fields are foremost communities of people, this has several implications for a young researcher:

* You have to be part of a community (to strive, be furthered, be rooted). THis will have a lasting effect on your career when played well (networking)

* You can only be part of a very few communities (if plural is possible here anyway) without loosing this community effect

* When choosing the community (i.e., the new feeds you read; venues you publish at; senior researchers to follow), don't just look at the name and what academic concept / task it describes; look also at the people and the "groove" amongst them. Can this become your professional home?

* When you found your home, think of becoming a part of its professional organization (e.g., a special interest group of SI, ACM or IEEE); engange in tasks in this community (serving on committees of conferences, as a reviewer, as an editor); this is a first step to long-lasting and fruitful professional relationships
