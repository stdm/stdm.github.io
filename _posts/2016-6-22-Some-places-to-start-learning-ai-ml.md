Here are some links to my favourite [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)s on learning or deepen Artificial Intelligence and in particular Machine Learning / Deep Learning skills (last update: Feb 23, 2018):

Generally: If you want to make AI/ML (or more broadly, data science) a career, check out the following guides:

  * [How to Become a Data Scientist](https://www.experfy.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-part-1-3) by Alex Smith (also [part 2](https://www.experfy.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-part-2-3))
  * [Data Scientist als Beruf](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/HMD_2016.pdf) by my colleagues Kurt, Andreas and myself (in German)
  * [A survival Guide to a PhD](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/) by Andrej Karpathy

Additionally, try attending the events of the [Zurich Machine learning & Data Science Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Zurich-Machine-Learning/) and think about joining [SGAICO](http://www.s-i.ch/sgaico/).

My announced blog post series on favourite books is still to be postponed, though. Amazing how fast calendars tend to get filled with other stuff...
