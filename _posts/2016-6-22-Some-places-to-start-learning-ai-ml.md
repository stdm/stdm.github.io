Here's a (regularly updated) collection of links to my favourite [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)s and other ressources on learning or deepen Artificial Intelligence and in particular Machine Learning / Deep Learning skills:

  * [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng, Stanford (very intuitive and practical, includes the basics)
  * [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai
  * [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) by Andrej Karpathy, Stanford ([video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uiulzZxmGg&index=10&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA))
  * [Theories of Deep Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Theories-of-Deep-Learning) by Hatef Monajemi, David Donoho and Vardan Papyan, Stanford
  * [Advanced Topics: Reinforcement Learning](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) by David Silver, University College London ([video lectures](http://videolectures.net/rldm2015_silver_reinforcement_learning/))
  * [Deep Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures) by Pieter Abbeel et al., UC Berkeley
  * [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml) by David Rosenberg, Bloomberg (more geared towards math and statistical learning than Andrew's course above)
  * [KI1: Artificial Intelligence](https://stdm.github.io/ai-course/) by Thilo Stadelmann at ZHAW, based on the [AIMA book](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)

An [alternative collection](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/10-free-must-see-courses-machine-learning-data-science.html) of courses (partially overlapping, though) is curated by the KDnuggest team.

If you are completely new to the topic of deep learning or even consider yourself a layperson in computer science, but want to get an introduction to some current frontiers of the state of the art, you can have a look at the excellent popular scientific compilation of [Spektrum der Wissenschaft kompakt 06.18: Künstliche Intelligenz - wie Maschinen lernen lernen](https://www.spektrum.de/pdf/spektrum-kompakt-kuenstliche-intelligenz-maschinelles-lernen/1588356).
