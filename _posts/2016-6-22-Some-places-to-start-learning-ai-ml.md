Here's a (regularly updated) collection of links to my favourite [MOOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course)s and other ressources on learning or deepen Artificial Intelligence and in particular Machine Learning / Deep Learning skills:

  * [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng, Stanford (very intuitive and practical, includes the basics)
  * [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) by Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai
  * [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) by Andrej Karpathy, Stanford ([video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uiulzZxmGg&index=10&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA))
  * [Theories of Deep Learning](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Theories-of-Deep-Learning) by Hatef Monajemi, David Donoho and Vardan Papyan, Stanford
  * [Advanced Topics: Reinforcement Learning](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) by David Silver, University College London ([video lectures](http://videolectures.net/rldm2015_silver_reinforcement_learning/))
  * [Deep Reinforcement Learning Bootcamp](https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures) by Pieter Abbeel et al., UC Berkeley
  * [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml) by David Rosenberg, Bloomberg (more geared towards math and statistical learning than Andrew's course above)

These reading resources might also be of interest (use cases, deep dives into specific methods):

  * on CNNs 
      * [Deep learning and neural networks](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen: a gentle introduction to neural networks in e-book form

      * [ML best practices](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/rules-of-ml/)
      * Interesting 4-post series on [Learning in Brains and Machines](http://blog.shakirm.com/2016/02/learning-in-brains-and-machines-1/)

Generally: If you want to make AI/ML (or more broadly, data science) a career, check out the following guides:

  * [How to Become a Data Scientist](https://www.experfy.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-part-1-3) by Alex Smith (also [part 2](https://www.experfy.com/blog/how-to-become-a-data-scientist-part-2-3))
  * [Data Scientist als Beruf](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/HMD_2016.pdf) by my colleagues Kurt, Andreas and myself (in German -> updated and revised version in English coming soon as a [book](https://stdm.github.io/data-science-book/))
  * [A survival Guide to a PhD](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/) by Andrej Karpathy

Additionally, try attending events of the [Swiss Alliance for Data-Intensive Services](http://www.data-service-alliance.ch), think about joining [SGAICO](http://www.s-i.ch/sgaico/), and subscribe to the [Data Machina newsletter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/datamachina).
