Dear (prospective) ZHAW student,
a very warm welcome to academia! You may just have entered the bachelor's programme or "Fachstudium", or you are already a mature engineer, ready to start your master's studies - chances are you haven't been exposed much yet to our setting of learning within an applied research and development context.

I will hopefully write more about what it means to do applied research and development in the future (yep - [here it is](Doing-applied-science)). Until then, this blog post may point you to a few resources helpful in

  * shaping your mindset as being rooted in research and geared towards applications
  * giving you advice on how to aproach thesis work and writing in general
  * provides you with some pointer to additional study resources to major in the (attention, strong opinion) most interesting of all fields: artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning.

Here you go: you may want to have a look at...

  * [This post](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/) by [Andrej Karpathy](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/) (one possible role model of a successful student) on how to do Ph.D. studies is a very good read also for every undergraduate / graduate student: (a) it gives a very illuminating glimpse of how the research lab behind the lecturer works, and how the researchers (including the lecturer) think; (b) it has an incredibly well-written section on how to write a good paper (and, by derivation, a good thesis) -> if you just remember one thing, it's "core contribution"; (c) it has a very good section on how to select an advisor (and how the advisor selects you) -> this is a lot about different styles that have to match well, just as in any relationship (for example, I tend to be very enthusiastic, but demanding)
  * [PA_BA-Howto](../downloads/PA_BA-Howto.pdf) by Martin Braschler and myself on how to write a thesis at ZHAW; very good supplementary material to Karpathy's post (in German).
  * [Bewertungsschema_CH](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/Bewertungsschema_CH.xlsx) edited by myself, serving as my "Bauchgefühlobjektivierer" when it comes to grading theses and presentations (in German). If you have a careful look at the criteria and their weighting, you know exactly what matters (to me). 
  * While we're at it: here's a [LaTex template](http://stdm.github.io/downloads/LaTeX_PABA_Vorlage_Rev.0.zip) for ZHAW thesis reports.
  * [This post](Some-places-to-start-learning-ai-ml) by [myself](https://www.zhaw.ch/de/ueber-uns/person/stdm/) on where to find additional resorces to be educated in AI and machine learning. Includes links to very good MOOCs, to exciting blog posts with intuitive explanations and code for recent techniques and applications, and to more general advice on how to build a career as a [data scientist](www.zhaw.ch/datalab) out of this.
  * [This post](Publish-as-you-go) by myself on the (personal and organizational) importance of developing a mindset that is eager to publish valuable results. It is not about the publication; it is about pursuing things that are valuable potentially also to others, and about developing healthy self esteem that says "I can recognize if I did good work, and it will likely benefit others".
  * [This post](Getting-to-know-oneself) by myself on getting to one's own personal strengths and weaknesses that will have an impact on one's career.
