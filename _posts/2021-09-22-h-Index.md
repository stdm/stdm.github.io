Here's a small script I wrote, using Python, [scholarly](https://scholarly.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html) and [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), to calculate one's [h-Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) per year (so you can see how it evolved over your life as a researcher). It tells me in what periods of my career I have been most active in producing most 'impactful' research output. I missed such capability in otherwise great tools for citation analysis like [Harzing's Publish or Perish](https://harzing.com/resources/publish-or-perish).

This is a script uses Google Scholar to calculate and plot the evolution of the 
h-index of a researcher over the years.
