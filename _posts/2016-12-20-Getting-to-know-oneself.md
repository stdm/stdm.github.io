Over the last 15 years, I've got to value certain personality tests (yes, the very thing <a href="https://www.dasmagazin.ch/2016/12/03/ich-habe-nur-gezeigt-dass-es-die-bombe-gibt/" target="_blank">Cambridge Analytica just reported to be able to create out of 10 of your social media likes</a>; but potential ethical drawbacks of big data or the topic of another post).

I like such tests because you can easily learn a lot about yourself by just answering 20-100 carefully designed questions quickly and truthfully, and it never stops to amaze me how accurate I find myself described after taking such a test (offline, of course, with pen&paper). The take home messages I get from these results easily outperform what I had a hard time figuring out introspecting myself over extended amounts of time. They show me my potential in certain areas, but also certain weaknesses that is good to be aware of (and be it only to be less annoying to fellow people).

Following is a list of links to some such test systems that I found interesting over the years. Use it as a resource if you want to learn more about yourself, and judge the results for yourself (sorry, links are mostly in German as these are the sources I know):

  * <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers-Briggs-Typenindikator" target="_blank">MBTI Myers-Briggs type indicator</a>: state of the art method that tells you how you perceive the world and make decisions. Very accurate, but expensive. Used by big companies during their executive training. Distinguishes 16 types. A free test is available after registration <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
  * <a href="http://www.gluecksdetektiv.de/innere-antreiber/" target="_blank">Innere Antreiber</a>: a quick test to show you how your mind pushes you to get things done. Only in German. here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.lerncoaching-berlin.com/antreibertest.html" target="_blank">free link</a>.
  * <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISG" target="_blank">DISG personal profile</a> (DISC in english): a lightweight professional profile using the 4 quadrants of &#8220;dominant&#8221;, &#8220;initiativ&#8221;, &#8220;stetig&#8221; and &#8220;gewissenhaft&#8221;. Not state of the art, but ofton good enough. <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Das-persolog-Pers%C3%B6nlichkeits-Profil-Pers%C3%B6nliche-Selbstauswertung/dp/3897493527/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1482245729&sr=8-5&keywords=disg" target="_blank">The book</a> containing the test is quite cheap.
  * <a href="http://www.enneagramm.de/" target="_blank">The Enneagramm</a>: developed by catholic monks in medieval times, the languange sounds archaic (or esoteric), but the results are as insightful as with a modern test, and there is nothing spooky about the system. Based on the dominant emotions of 9 different types.
  * <a href="https://www.springest.de/bildung-lehre/lehrfahigkeiten/lernstile-test-kolb" target="_blank">Kolb&#8217;s learning inventory</a> (haven&#8217;t used this website myself): tells you quite accurately how you learn best. It&#8217;s amazing how this knowledge can boost your learning success (or just explain why you always structure your studies, discussions etc. a certain way and get mad when others do differently).
  * <a href="https://www.amazon.de/5-Love-Languages-Gary-Chapman/dp/0802411401/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1482245831&sr=8-2&keywords=the+5+love+languages" target="_blank">The 5 love languages</a>: ok, this is less of a personal profile than a characterization of what you need in relationships. Originally written for couples, there are numerous applications also in a professional context. There&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/" target="_blank">test online</a> that I haven&#8217;t tried yet.
