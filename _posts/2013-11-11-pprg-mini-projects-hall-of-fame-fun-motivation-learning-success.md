**Fun -> Motivation -> Learning success**

This semester I teach introduction to programming (PPRG) to aviation engineers. For first-semester non-computer-scientists, Java can be sort of a challenge. After having taught how to use variables, conditionals and loops, the last assignment has been:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em> &#8220;Write an applet for whatever you like; use variables, loops and the if-statement; you have 2 weeks time (=4h guided self study)&#8221;.</em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The main focus of these &#8220;mini projects&#8221; should be on training what I taught in class, with the motivational aspect of &#8220;do what pleases you&#8221;. Usually I place a high emphasis on motivation/passion because I feel its a great driving force for learning success.<!--more-->
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  I am the more pleased to present here the three applets that impressed me the most, because to me they display some motivation beyond &#8220;I just want to get that grade&#8221;. Authors from classes AV13b and AV12t, you know who you are, so I omit the names here.

  <strong>Gold Medal</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gold.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-92 aligncenter" alt="gold" src="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gold.png" width="608" height="441" /></a>This tank-commander simulation foremost has great game-play: it is fun to chase the bunker while trying to avoid hitting the president&#8217;s palace. The nice rules, animations and sound effects add to this &#8220;just one more try&#8221; effect.<a href="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/gold.png"><br /> </a>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <strong>Silver Medal</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/silber.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-93 aligncenter" alt="silber" src="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/silber.png" width="415" height="479" /></a>You have to see this in action in order to feel the fascination: three planes start at random from different positions at the borders of the window and proceed with different velocities nicely animated towards and beyond the center of the applet. It really gives the impression of looking at a radar screen.

  <strong>Bronze Medal</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bronze.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-91 aligncenter" alt="bronze" src="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/bronze.png" width="492" height="624" /></a>Once again nice gameplay with this &#8220;just one more&#8221; effect: Scissors-Rock-Paper against a computer player, with the wins/losses contributing to a soccer match. What keeps me playing is the animated statistics for which choice has been how successful.

  <strong>Selection Criteria</strong>
</p>

Briefly on my selection criteria for this hall of fame: I _just_ looked what did appeal the most to me &#8211; I looked for fascination. This includes some valuable aspects such as

  * good design
  * some completeness regarding features / functionality
  * &#8230;

but it completely disregards other important aspects of good solutions to this assignment (coding style, difficulty of the task, &#8230;). So if you read this and your applet is missing, its not because it is bad. I am sure you learnt a lot from it, and thats the ultimate goal of every assignment during the course.
