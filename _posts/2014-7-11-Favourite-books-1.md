I love books; I enjoy reading them, and I recently learend (<a href="http://hochschuldidaktik.phzh.ch/de/CAS-Lehrgange/CAS_Hochschuldidaktik/Programm_Sommerstart/" target="_blank">here</a>) that reading books is even the best way I can learn (that might be different for you, though).

So, here&#8217;s the beginning of a loosely coupled series of blog posts regarding my book shelfs: I want to introduce you to some of my favourites, hopefully with a short sentence of what I like about those volumes.

This is the first part of my reference books that I keep in my ZHAW office &#8211; my precious AI/algorithm textbooks. Let&#8217;s see what we have here (incomplete &#8211; only the favourites):

  * Minsky&#8217;s &#8220;The Society of Mind&#8221;: A collection of visionary one-page essays on artificial intelligence that a deem to be very inspiring (though haven&#8217;t read much of it, I must confess).
  * Russel/Norvig&#8217;s &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221;: The famous &#8220;Agent book&#8221;, _the_ textbook on AI; I am going to base a course on this.
  * Smith&#8217;s &#8220;Digital Signal Processing&#8221;: Thank god someone wrote a book on the fascinating topic of DSP that is comprehensible not only for electrical engineers; I found it very accessible & practical!
  * Bishop&#8217;s &#8220;Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning&#8221;: Very mathematical (at least from my point of view), but without flaws and errors (this is seldom!) &#8211; if you have the time, you can really work through all of the formulae even as a non-mathematician.
  * Mitchel&#8217;s &#8220;Machien Learning&#8221;: The first textbook on the topic; I very much appreciate the systematics in it (although it doesn&#8217;t cover all the now famous algorithms like SVMs).
  * Witten & Frank&#8217;s &#8220;Data Mining&#8221;: Very accessible introduction to data mining and machine learning, very practical.
  * Press et al.&#8217;s &#8220;Numerical Recipes in C&#8221;: It saved my a\*** when I had to handcode several linear algebra algorithms; although there are more standard libraries now (so it will seldom be needed to handcode) this is _the_ reference on implementing numerical stuff.
  * Skiena&#8217;s &#8220;Algorithm Design Manual&#8221;: Best (and fun to read!) introduction to algorithms and data structures.
  * Knuth&#8217;s &#8220;The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes I-III&#8221;: What can I say&#8230; among the top-100 most influencing science books of the last century, masterpiece,  foundation of computer science, a modern classic etc.; you should always cite it at least once. Both the humor and rigor in it is remarkable.
