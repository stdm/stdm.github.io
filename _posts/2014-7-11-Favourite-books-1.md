I love books; I enjoy reading them, and I recently learend ([here](https://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html)) that reading books is even the best way I can learn (that might be different for you, though).

So, here's the beginning of a loosely coupled series of blog posts regarding my book shelfs: I want to introduce you to some of my favourites, hopefully with a short sentence of what I like about those volumes.

[AI books](http://stdm.github.io/images/ai-books.jpg)

This is the first part of my reference books that I keep in my ZHAW office - my precious AI/algorithm textbooks. Let's see what we have here (incomplete - only the favourites):

  * Minsky's "The Society of Mind": A collection of visionary one-page essays on artificial intelligence that a deem to be very inspiring (though haven't read much of it, I must confess).
  * Russell/Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence": The famous "Agent book", _the_ textbook on AI; I am going to base a course on this.
  * Smith's "Digital Signal Processing": Thank god someone wrote a book on the fascinating topic of DSP that is comprehensible not only for electrical engineers; I found it very accessible & practical!
  * Bishop's "Pattern Recognition & Machine Learning": Very mathematical (at least from my point of view), but without flaws and errors (this is seldom!) - if you have the time, you can really work through all of the formulae even as a non-mathematician.
  * Mitchel's "Machine Learning": The first textbook on the topic; I very much appreciate the systematics in it (although it doesn't cover all the now famous algorithms like SVMs).
  * Witten & Frank's "Data Mining": Very accessible introduction to data mining and machine learning, very practical.
  * Press et al.'s "Numerical Recipes in C": It saved my a\*** when I had to handcode several linear algebra algorithms; although there are more standard libraries now (so it will seldom be needed to handcode) this is _the_ reference on implementing numerical stuff.
  * Skiena's "Algorithm Design Manual": Best (and fun to read!) introduction to algorithms and data structures.
  * Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes I-III": What can I say - among the top-100 most influencing science books of the last century, masterpiece, foundation of computer science, a modern classic etc.; you should always cite it at least once. Both the humor and rigor in it is remarkable.
