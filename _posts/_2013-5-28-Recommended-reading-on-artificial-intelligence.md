I started to read Nils Nilssons's [Quest for Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf). It is intended to be also readable for the interested layperson, but should give a good and readable overview of the field with a historic perspective: way pursued, paths abandoned, goals reached.

What makes me curious is what Prof. Nilsson himself points out in the foreword: maybe some abandoned ideas from the path are more realistic with todays technology (computing power, distributed systems, learning from massive amounts of data, &#8230;).

The eBook (PDF) Version is availabale for free from Prof. Nilsson's [homepage](http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/QAI/qai.pdf).
