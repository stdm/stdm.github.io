Never before I have seen a restaurant where you are allowed to draw on the tablecloth except [here](href="http://www.hirschli.ch/):

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-35" alt="Table drawing in the &quot;Hirschli&quot;, Baden" src="https://dublin.zhaw.ch/~stdm/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hirschli_baden_table_drawing.jpg" width="561" height="418" />](http://stdm.github.io/images/hirschli_baden_table_drawing.jpg)

I liked it; somehow a drawing emerged that bothered me over the last few weeks.
