  <h1>Welcome & news</h1>
  
  <p>This is the personal website of <a href="http://www.zhaw.ch/=stdm">Thilo Stadelmann</a>, professor of AI/ML at <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/">ZHAW</a> <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/">School of Engineering</a> and holder of the chair of Engineering-Information, director of centre of the <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/en/engineering/institutes-centres/cai/">Centre for Artificial Intelligence</a> and head of the <a href="https://stdm.github.io/research/">Machine Perception and Cognition Group</a>. In a second life, I am a (co-)founder and board member of <a href="https://alpineai.ch/">AlpineAI AG</a>, the <a href="https://www.zhaw.ch/datalab">ZHAW Datalab</a>, and the <a href="https://data-innovation.org/">data innovation alliance</a>. All views expressed are mine.</p>

  <p>I am a computer scientist by training, an AI guy by passion, and a machine perception researcher by area of study. My research interests revolve around general principles for representation learning algorithms in deep learning for pattern recognition. I approach these by means of use cases from very diverse areas, e.g. multimedia analysis, speech and audio processing, optical music recognition, predictive maintenance, automated game playing, data mining, driving assistants, computer vision, face recognition, ...</p>

  <p>My current <a href="https://stdm.github.io/research/">research interests</a> revolve around robust and interpretable deep neural networks for pattern recognition problems, and reinforcement learning for general control to close the action-perception loop.</p>

  <p>Personally, I like kitesurfing and mountainbiking, enjoy playing music on stringed instruments (guitars, bass), and am a follower of <a href="https://odb.org/">Jesus Christ</a>. I try living by the following values (my closer colleagues know I am not there yet): excellence; wisdom; honor all people; mercy for failure; and courage.</p>
